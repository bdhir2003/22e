  I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with over 3 years of experience creating dynamic web applications. I love working with modern technologies like React, Node.js, and Python to build solutions that solve real-world problems.

  My journey in tech started with curiosity and has evolved into a career focused on continuous learning and innovation. I enjoy collaborating with teams, mentoring junior developers, and contributing to open-source projects.

  When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, or working on personal projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.
